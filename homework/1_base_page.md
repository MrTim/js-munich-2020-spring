# Homework 1 -- Base Page

Thanks for joining us for Frontend Development 2. We want to start the class off with a simple base
page we can build off in future lessons. Quarantine is challenging so lets share some places we miss
visiting around the city. Please build a simple html page following the criteria below.

### Criteria:

Page:
- Has background color other then '#fff'
- Contains a header, footer, and main div
- Text should not be pure #000 black

Header:
- This is the part at the top of the page that is used to navigate the site
- Should use \<header\> html tag
- Should contain three links: home, about me, and base page
- The "base page" link should be different to signify it is the current page
    - change color or background color for that link

Main div:
- This is the main container in the middle of the page containing the page's unique content. The
  header and footer are more or less the same of every page but the content of the main div will
  change
- This is where we want to highlight the things in Munich we miss
- Include three sections using \<section\> tags
- Each section should include
    1. the title of the place, ex "Boulderwelt Ost"
    2. a picture of the place using \<img\>
    3. a google maps link to the place with text "location"
    4. a description of at least a sentence in length on why you miss it

Footer:
- Should use \<footer\> html tag
- Should contain the following text "made by x for REDI: Frontend Development 2"
    - where x is your name


### Submission:
In the second lesson we will be covering how to commit and publish your code on github. For now
simply create the html page on you machines and have it ready for the start of the second class.
