# Mini Twitter project

## Description
Idea is to build a simple web version of twitter. Application should be able to send, display and delete twitter-like messages from other users. Would be nice if at least 3 students would build this project, because then it's more interesting to see messages from others.

TODO: create a simple example with layout and functionality.

## Spec
Basic functionality for this application:

1. User should be able to enter his/her name and all messages would be saved under that name.
2. Possibility to enter a message and send it.
3. Message should be stored in an external database.
4. On page reload all available messages from database should be displayed from last one to the earliest messages.
5. Messages rating - possibility for other user to upvote for the messages. Votes would be stored in database.

## What is difficult

1. External api to work with database API. Ofc teachers can provide placeholder functions to work with this API, but you should be able to understand the idea of it at the end.
2. Could be a lot of messages.

## External resource
Database - Firebase. API to do CRUD operations.
