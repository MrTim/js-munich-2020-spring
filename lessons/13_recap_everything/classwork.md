# Lesson 13 Classwork

Let's practice

## Exercises

- Create a function `reverseArray` which would reverse array and return it as a result
- You've given an array of teachers and you need to create a function which would iterate over it and return a string with all teachers names divided with `,`. Then do the same but usign `forEach`.
- Create a function `summation(n)` that takes a single argument n, and computes the sum of all integers up to n starting from 0:
```js
summation(3) -> 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
summation(7) -> 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28
```
- Create a small form with following fields: Name, Surname, Email address and Age. After user clicks "Submit" button please console log the object with complete user data.

## Bonus exercise
Build a "TO-DO list". That's it :)
Should be possible to add Todo items and remove then. Simple but nice to use.
