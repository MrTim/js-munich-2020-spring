# Lesson 6 Classwork

Let's practice working with objects

## Spec

We want to have a page that will display same type of information about you and your best friend

1. Create 2 objects : "me" and "friend"
2. Both objects should have same attributes
3. Minimum 4 attributes and 1 nested object with at least 2 attributes (example: favouriteBook)
4. Display all information from "me" and "friend" on web page

## Bonus
- Lets say you and your friend have exactly the same favourite book
- Can you create favouriteBook object separately, and use it both in "me" and "friend" objects?
