Start working on your little online store prototype and practice objects and arrays

> Important: do not forget to do your homework on a separate branch with meaningful name

1. Create a simple page to display products of your imaginary online store
2. Decide on 1 type of items sold (ex. cars, dresses, goats)
3. Create object representations of items you sell.
    * There shall be 4 items sold
    * Each item must have at least 4 simple attributes and 1 nested object
    * ALL items should have exactly same structure
4. Use array to store all objects together
